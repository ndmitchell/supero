I also find the description of deforestation techniques in Section 5.3 a
bit sloppy, and the citations rather arbitrary. First of all, it would
make more sense to cite Wadler's 1990 paper in TCS, rather than the
preceding conference version. Also, it is then said that his technique
was extended in many ways, among others to work on other data types than
lists. But already Wadler's original technique works for arbitrary
datatypes! After all, the title is "Transforming programs to eliminate
*trees*". Moreover, the citation of Coutts et al. 2007b is rather
strange in this context. Their technique has nothing to do with
Wadler-style deforestation. If anything, it would be an example for
combinator/rules-based optimizations as described in the subsequent
paragraph. In that paragraph, it is implied that shortcut fusion and
related techniques are restricted to lists. But again, these have
straightforward extensions to arbitrary datatypes (see "A Generalization
of Short-Cut Fusion and its Correctness Proof", Johann, HOSC 2002).

There is a large literature on termination orderings which goes almost
entirely uncited. Is there a reason for this?
